# I-Dream-of-Parking
Parking lot program that assigns users spots using an algorithm designed to maximize parking lot efficiency.
This project underwent a full spiral development life cycle, and in this repo you will find all the documentation 
that went with the development of this project. My contribution to this project was mostly towards the front end, as well
as contributions towards the generation of "cars" going into the parking lot as well as the algorithm that dictates where 
those "cars" would be assigned. Demos available with empty, half full, and full parking lots. For administrative actions 
I've also uploaded a list of accepted admin passwords.
